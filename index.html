        <p>This so called <b>RoboCar</b> is a model for a robot that follows human 
        or any object that is ahead of it. This <b>RoboCar</b> was created by the group of students 
        <b> GROUP GEEKS</b> from technical section 
          of  <a target=”_blank”  href="https://www.facebook.com/sssdamak/"> Shree Saraswati Secondary School</a> as 
         their final year project.
         By combining the practical and programming knowledge gained in 4 years, the <b>GEEKS</b> made this 
         piece of technology work succesfully.

            <div class="txtarduino"><b>Arduino</b>  is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
                 Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it 
                 into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to
                  do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. </div>
